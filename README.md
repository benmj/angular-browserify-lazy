goals
-----

To scaffold a project using AngularJS, CommonJS style (compiled with [browserify](http://browserify.org)), in which modules are bundled individually and loaded asynchronously.


instructions
------------

`npm install && bower install && grunt dev` - serve the files out of the `dist/` folder. I use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.org/package/http-server).
